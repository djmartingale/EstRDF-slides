Not necessary in power flow calculation. Delivery element will be called edge. Another concept, bus, represent the place where two different delivery elements joint or end of a delivery element, but there is no physical entity corresponding to a bus. There are three common types of buses: type know quantities slack bus voltage magnitude and phase angle PQ bus real power injection and reactive power injection PV bus real power injection and voltage magnitude It is sufficient to model most of RDFs with PQ buses and one kind of edges, cables: One slack bus in RDF, corresponding to the root. Root not in any matrix. Ignore other delivery elements.
