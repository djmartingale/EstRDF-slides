How households are connected to distribution network is always unknown. A framework to infer such connections by utilising all kinds of information is proposed in this project. Problem Setting How households are connected to distribution network is usually unknown. Available information for topology inference: There are three kinds of available information in this project. geographical information about buses voltage magnitudes of all the phases of all the buses some real power injection profiles For example, where they are located and barriers between them. There is no literature mentioning how to handle geographical information. Association network inference: In the literature, a technique called association network inference is usually used. Correlation between entities are derived based on some entity attributes. The face that number of edges in a mathematical tree is always 1 less than number of entities makes the problem simpler. Correlation between entities. \\(|\\mathcal{E}| = |\\mathcal{N}| - 1\\) However, there are two reasons why such technique cannot be used here. Spurious correlation resulted from correlated profiles. Missing entity attribute. The second reason will be discussed in detail later. Flowchart There are three columns. In the left column, ground truth, the true topology, is known, and used to simulate available measurement using power flow program. Three boxes in the middle represents three kinds of information disucssed before. Note that ground truth is not known and we want to find it. Programs in the right column are used to make inference about the topology. Ground truth is not known, but used to simulate available measurement. Two batches of computer programs: power flow three algorithms to handle directed graphs The second batch will not be discussed in detail. "],["radial-distribution-feeder.html", "2 Radial Distribution Feeder", " 2 Radial Distribution Feeder Essential concepts are discussed in following three parts. bus and edge, -&gt; 2.1 two special concepts for power flow, -&gt; 2.2 case with 70 buses, -&gt; 2.3 "],["bus-edge.html", "2.1 Bus and Edge", " 2.1 Bus and Edge Power grids can be roughly described here by following three concepts. type definition examples edge transport power from one place to another cable, transformer, capacitor conversion element convert power from or to another form solar panel, battery bus where two edges joint or end of an edge slack bus, PQ bus, PV bus Only one type of edge, cable, is considered. The method applies when there are transformers, capacitors, and other devices. Usually, there is one slack bus in distribution network and is referred to as root here. Ignore conversion elements. Not necessary in power flow calculation. Cable. One slack bus -&gt; root. Impedance of cable is proportional to its length.

Diagonal values are the same, and two times of off-diagonal values. So it is sufficient to store this matrix with one number for resistance and one number for reactance.

Such two concepts cannot be found in the literature, but are essential for power flow when taking multiple phases into account.
